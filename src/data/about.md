Hi. I'm a multidisciplinary design and product leader with a rich history of building high-performing design teams inside fast-moving companies. My product design work spans 0-1 and foundational products. I help design teams grow, build more agency, and reduce ambiguity while improving their ability to make high-quality decisions.

Across my leadership roles, I've managed the entire lifecycle of design orgs from recruiting to retaining, and have transformed how teams communicate, align, and work. I use storytelling as both a design tool and a leadership tool, helping cross-functional partners understand what matters, why it matters, and how to act on it.

My work blends systems thinking, design operations, product strategy, and customer obsession, I am driven by curiosity as well as empathy — allowing me to create clarity in environments that are volatile, ambiguous, or undergoing rapid transformation. I am passionate about the long tail of compounding systems, but balance that against experience which has taught me that in the right context (with the right guardrails), speed and shipping can matter more.

I am based in Chicago
