I founded a digital agency specializing in Travel and Event Production with several colleagues from Leapnet. I lead our work in Travel with Orbitz where 212 functioned as an outsourced UX and Product Design team, working closely across the original airline partners, and C-suit at Orbitz where I launched many early innovations in travel booking including the patented Flight Matrix™ display for Orbitz.

212 designed the original hotel and package products, and built the foundational experience for Orbitz. After a successful few years working with Orbitz via 212, we closed down the agency and I and several partners joined Orbitz to continue the journey.
