# Bootstrapped a digital agency focussed on travel and event production
&nbsp;

Co-Founded a boutique web design and event production agency where I served as CEO, and lead the work for our travel clients. All the partners wore many hats, we were self-funded, and started with offices in my apartment. We eventually grew into a downtown office and scaled the agency to 25 employees and ~$20M in revenues in our last year.
