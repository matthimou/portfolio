# Bootstrapped a boutique agency focussed on travel and events
&nbsp;

Co-Founded a boutique web design and event production agency where I served as CEO and lead the work for our travel clients. All the partners wore many hats, we were self-funded, and started with offices in my apartment. We eventually grew into a beautiful downtown loft office & scaled the agency to 25 employees and ~$20M in revenues in our last year.

Key Projects: Orbitz, Nike, Amadeus, SwissHotel, Trace Magazine
