# Co-founded a VC-backed dating startup
&nbsp;

Wore every product hat at a seed-funded startup—design, product strategy, user research, customer service - you name it. First experience navigating board dynamics and investor relations while shipping fast with a tiny team.

- **Product/design owner** in 3 growing to 5 person team
- **Secured seed funding** and helped manage board relationships
- **Shipped cloud-native product** with zero physical infrastructure early in the cloud transition
