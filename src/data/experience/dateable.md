# Co-founded a dating service startup, leading product, design, and customer service.
&nbsp;

This was my first experience with getting a startup funded, working directly with a board-of-directors to develop plans and evaluate performance. We were a tiny 3-person team - I had a technical and marketing co-founder - everything else about the product fell to me. We had no physical office, and our infra was all in the cloud. 

After leaving Orbitz which grew to be a huge international organization, Dateable reminded me how to be scrappy and wear many hats simultaneously, and how much a small team with high agency can accomplish. It was the shortest of my tenures, but I learned so much about doing more with less I will always appreciate.
