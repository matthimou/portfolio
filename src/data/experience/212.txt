Founded a digital agency specializing in Travel and Event Production with several colleagues from Leapnet. I lead our work with Orbitz. 212 functioned as an outsourced UX and Product Design team to get Orbitz launched, working closely across the original airline partners, and launched many early innovations in travel booking including the patented Flight Matrix™ display for Orbitz.

212 designed the original hotel and package products, and built the foundational experience for Orbitz. After a successful few years working with Orbitz via 212, we closed down the agency and I and several partners joined Orbitz to continue the journey.
