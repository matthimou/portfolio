Originally hired as Director of Design for International (due to my experience at Orbitz and Groupon building international platforms), 3 months into my tenure the Director of Consumer Design left and I stepped in to backfill this role. I lead all of Consumer Design for about 8 months while I helped hire a Senior Director of Consumer Design, then focussed on the Core Consumer Platform team, responsible for the "Golden Flow" (all the key revenue generating pages in the primary consumer experience). My team was organized by the customer journey into Discovery > Order Experience > Delivery Experience and covered all facets of the core customer journey for restaurant delivery that all other teams used and integrated into. We were also responsible for the Cx Design System and maintaining a high bar for craft and quality across the consumer teams.
