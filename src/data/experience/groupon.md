# Led Consumer and Merchant experience at a leading local marketplace
&nbsp;

Co-Director, Consumer Product Design --> Director, Consumer Product Design --> Director, Merchant & Consumer Product Design

Co-led the consumer design team initially, eventually leading all of design across Consumer & Merchant. I managed global teams across US/Europe/Asia, helped launch a successful redesign, built a global platform while managing a team of about ~40 across Product Design, Research, Design Systems & Front-end Engineering. This work led to the next key area of focus for me in my career - local marketplaces. 

Across both Groupon and DoorDash opportunities I developed deep expertise in local economies, logistics, merchant pain points, etc that translated well to the next phase of my journey at DoorDash.
