# Scaled design globally at the pioneer of local commerce
&nbsp;

Led Consumer and Merchant design through the transition from a single Groupon a day to establishing a rich local marketplace, and a pandemic that almost destroyed it. I started here on the consumer side of design, and added merchant in the later half of my tenure. Groupon was a mix of many 0-1 projects (POS for Restaurants, Dating (true story), Beauty Booking, Food Delivery, Restaurant Reservations, etc), and large gnarly platform efforts.
