&nbsp;

Led Consumer and Merchant design through the transition from a single Groupon a day to establishing a rich local marketplace, and a pandemic that almost destroyed it. Groupon was a good mix of 0-1 projects (POS for restaurants, dating, beauty booking, food delivery, restaurant reservations, just to name a few...), and large gnarly platform  or architecture efforts to scale the business.
