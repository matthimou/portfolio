Co-led the consumer design team initially, but eventually led all of design @Groupon across Consumer and Merchant platforms. Managed global teams across US/Europe/Asia. Similar to Orbitz front-end development here reported into the design org. In my final years I also led the merchant experience team, building all the tooling to make merchants successful on our platform.
