Worked my way up at a private advertising agency that went public during the dot com boom. Hired originally to do development, I eventually became the CTO of Quantum Leap (a web services arm of Leapnet), where I launched the travel practice and won and led our largest customer accounts including Chicago Tribune, MSNBC, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airlines, British Airways, Hilton Hotels, and many others.
