# Technology & design leadership at a traditional advertising agency turned web services firm
&nbsp;

Joined an advertising agency that went public during the dot com boom. Became the CTO of a subsidiary. Served as CTO for 2 years when I got the chance to lead our efforts to design American Airlines first web experience. After launching American's site left the CTO post and launched a travel practice where I became the Director to manage a growing list of travel clients. This work launched much of the first half of my career which was heavily focussed on the online travel space.

Projects: American Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airlines, British Airways, a joint venture between Hilton, Forte, & Accor Hotels, Sam's Club, Walmart, Chicago Tribune, MSNBC, Nike, US Robotics
