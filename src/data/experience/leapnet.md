# Served as CTO and Travel Practice Director
&nbsp;

Joined an advertising agency that went public during the dot com boom. Became the CTO of Quantum Leap (a web services subsidiary of Leapnet). After serving as CTO for 2 years I launched a travel practice after leading the design of American Airlines first web experience. This work launched the first half of my career which was heavily focussed on leading the design efforts of travel experience teams.
