Originally hired as Director of Design for International, 3 months into my tenure the Director of Consumer Design left and I stepped in to backfill this role. I lead all of Consumer Design for about 8 months while I helped hire a Senior Director of Consumer Design, then focussed on the Core Consumer Platform team, responsible for the "Golden Flow" (all the key revenue generating pages in the primary consumer experience). My team was organized by the customer journey into Discovery > Order Experience > Delivery Experience and covered all facets of the core customer journey while overseeing all the key surfaces in the golden flow (that all other teams used and integrated into). We were also responsible for the Cx Design System and maintaining a high bar for craft and quality across the consumer journey. I led the Consumer Design Review there for most of my tenure, where all projects that get shipped to customers get approved.
