# Led Consumer Design at the worlds leading delivery service
&nbsp;

Director, International Product Design --> Director, Consumer Design --> Director, Core Consumer Design.

Responsible for the "Golden Flow" (the key revenue generating pages in the consumer experience). My team was organized by the customer journey into 3 charters -- Discovery, Order Experience, and Delivery Experience (with multiple surface teams in each charter), and covered all facets of the core customer journey from discovery through delivery. 

Responsible for the Cx Design System and maintaining a high bar for craft and quality across the consumer journey. As key surface owners my team played a dual role as both design leads for the core products and surface owners helping the rest of the consumer teams integrate their features into the key surfaces we owned. I led the Consumer Design Review for most of my tenure, where all project teams reviewed and got work aproved before shipping to customers.

Over my tenure product planning & strategy in design shifted from reactive ad-hoc requests coming out of quarterly planning to design-led & sprint-based co-planning across disciplines, empowering design to more effectively contribute to & shape the strategy and roadmap.
