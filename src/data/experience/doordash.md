Directed design for DoorDash's "Golden Flow"—the core consumer journey driving billions in GMV. Built and led teams across Discovery, Ordering, and Delivery, while establishing design quality standards across all consumer surfaces.

- **Led 3 design charters** covering the full customer journey
- **Owned the Cx Design System** and holding the craft bar across primary surfaces in the consumer experience
- **Shifted design from reactive to strategic** through sprint-based co-planning with cross-functional partners, expanding the use of prototyping, bringing in Leads at the charter (rather than team) level, and developing the cadence and rituals the Cx design org used to stay ahead of and help drive planning cycles.
