# Led Consumer Design at this local delivery marketplace
&nbsp;

Originally hired as Director of Design for International, 3 months into my tenure the Director of Consumer Design left and I stepped in to backfill this role. I lead all of Consumer Design for about 1.5 years while I helped hire a Senior Director of Consumer Design, then turned my focus to the Core Consumer Platform team. 

Responsible for the "Golden Flow" (all the key revenue generating pages in the primary consumer experience). My team was organized by the customer journey into Discovery > Order Experience > Delivery Experience charters (with multiple surface PODs in each charter) and covered all facets of the core customer journey from discovery through delivery. 

My team was also responsible for the Cx Design System and maintaining a high bar for craft and quality across the consumer journey as surface owners. I led the Consumer Design Review there for most of my tenure, where all projects that get shipped to customers get reviewed and approved by design and product.
