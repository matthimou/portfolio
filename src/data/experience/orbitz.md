Led the information architecture and UX research teams initially and grew into leading all of design. Grew Ux team from 10 people to ~200 across design, IA, research and front-end engineering. When I joined Orbitz was under 100 people, and when I left it was over 8000 teammates across continents. While working at Orbitz I was approached to co-found a new venture which led to my second startup - Dateable.
