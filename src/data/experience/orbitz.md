# Led design at the premier online travel agency
&nbsp;


Led the information architecture and UX research teams initially and grew into leading all of design. Grew Ux team from 10 people to ~200 across design, IA, research and front-end engineering (multiple brands and geographies). Experienced rapid growth here - when I joined Orbitz was under 100 people, and when I left it was over 8000 teammates across continents and being acquired by Expedia.

A big part of my journey here was helping to building out a massive global platform with feature-level configuration for each product line, that was capable of being styled for multiple brands. This was before we had design systems as we know them today.
