Led information architecture team, and UX research initially, eventually leading all of design. Grew the team from about 5 people to almost ~200 across design, IA, research and front-end engineering. Experienced my first hyper growth startup environment from a no-process org to a highly structured large organization struggling to move fast because of process and political overhead. When I joined Orbitz was under 100 people, and when I left it was over 8000 teammates across continents.
